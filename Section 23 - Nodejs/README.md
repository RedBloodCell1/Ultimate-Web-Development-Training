# Node.js

An asynchronous event-driven JS runtime, designed to build scalable network applications

## NOTES:

1. **Synchronous** = If we order something, we can't do anything else other than waiting for the order to come
2. **Asynchronous event-driven** = When we order something, we can do something else until the order come, then we can take the order. In summary it waits for some event?
3. **REPL** = Read Evaluate Print Loop
4. so Node is so just we can run JS in our computer and not just in web console
5. **Native Modules** = Pre bundled function
6. **NPM (Node Package Manager)** = Node library from a lot of other people (BLACKBOX THIS most of the time)
7. To install package, you can write **npm install "package name"**
8. **npm init** = To start npm project
9. to use **import**, we need to include **"type": "module"** to package.json

## Function:

1. **const fs = require("fs")** = import fileSystem to a const so we can use it
2. **fs.writeFile(fileName, fileContent, callbackFunction)** = to write file
