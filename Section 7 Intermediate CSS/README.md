# NOTES:

1. !important will overwrite any CSS, The top of the world

2. 4 positioning:

   - Static = default
   - Relative = so this is from the original position and moved
   - Absolute = so this is absolute from its ancestor OR the top left of the page if it has no ancestor with a position
   - Fixed = always relative to the top left of the browser window (so doesnt matter where u scroll it will be fixed right there on ur window)

3. z-index is like the third dimension where everything has 0 default z-index. The more the z-index, the more front it is on the page
