# NOTES

## Function:

1. **x.addEventListener("event" , listener)** = this is an event listener in which if the event is triggered, then the listener will be triggered. Listener can be anonymous function or named function
2. **debugger** = to debug a code. step by step
3. **switch** = switch case like if else but different

## Notes:

1. So with (), a function run instantly. With event listener, we dont use () so the function doesnt get triggered immediately because () is a method call
2. **constructor function** = title needs to start with capitalized letter

## Event:

1. click
2. keypress
