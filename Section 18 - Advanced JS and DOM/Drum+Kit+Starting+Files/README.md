# NOTES

## Function:

1. **x.addEventListener("event" , listener)** = this is an event listener in which if the event is triggered, then the listener will be triggered. Listener can be anonymous function or named function
2. **debugger** = to debug a code. step by step
3. **switch** = switch case like if else but different

2. **constructor function** = title needs to start with capitalized letter
3. **Higher order function** = a function that can take function as an input
4. **Callback function** = a function that is taken as an input in a function
