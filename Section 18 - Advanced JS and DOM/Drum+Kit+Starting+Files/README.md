# NOTES

## Function:

1. **x.addEventListener("event" , listener)** = this is an event listener in which if the event is triggered, then the listener will be triggered

## Notes:

1. So with (), a function run instantly. With event listener, we dont use () so the function doesnt get triggered immediately because () is a method call
