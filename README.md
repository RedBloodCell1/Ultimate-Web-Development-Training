Hello guys, It's me again. I have been gone for a while... Yeah, I have been sorting out my life. There is no deep reason for my disappearence. Its just I'm always getting lazy and lazy. Yeah you guys know how it goes. Its always been like this for the longest time now. Not something new. But I am back here, and will always be back no matter how long I stop for. Consider this my pledge.

So yeah, this lesson I am learning is a udemy lesson to be a fullstack dev. I always wanted to learn about everything inside out. I will take it slow and keep learning until I'm good enough. Well I will not talk to much, I will start. To see my progress. I will start to write the schedule of my study everytime I study.

Study Schedule:

- 02/11/2024 = 16:00 - 19.46 (1 hour)

- 17/12/2024 = 20:16 - 22:58 (31 minute 50 second)

YOOO THATS A LONG STOP. damn... welcome back me. Lets continue

- 19/12/2024 = 21:57 - 22:22 (5 minute)

- 26/12/2024 = 15:42 - 16:46 (20 minute 30 second)

I got no reason. Its really hard to keep up with things. Its always been like this. Stopping for a long time without coming back and it keeps repeating. How do i keep my discipline? I wanna be better. Its really harsh, the reality of life. Even tho I know that i need to study. My brain is so intoxicated in other things that studying become less of a priority.

Its 24/01/2025 today, its been quite a long time. Even if i spend an hour, i can only focus for an hour at best. This is just me trying to be fast at studying without taking my time slowly learning things. I feel really bad. But I know, there's no need to think so much. I just need to do what I need to do. Be more disciplined and keep going. I can't promise anything anymore because I dont wanna make a promise i can't keep. I know that I probably will stop again one day. But I promise that I will always come back. That is my promise. I don't know what kind of realization that I will get each time I come back. But I will be stronger.

- 24/01/2025 = 19:15 - 19:56 (27 Minute 16 Second)
