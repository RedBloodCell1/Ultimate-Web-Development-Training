Hello guys, It's me again. I have been gone for a while... Yeah, I have been sorting out my life. There is no deep reason for my disappearence. Its just I'm always getting lazy and lazy. Yeah you guys know how it goes. Its always been like this for the longest time now. Not something new. But I am back here, and will always be back no matter how long I stop for. Consider this my pledge.

So yeah, this lesson I am learning is a udemy lesson to be a fullstack dev. I always wanted to learn about everything inside out. I will take it slow and keep learning until I'm good enough. Well I will not talk to much, I will start. To see my progress. I will start to write the schedule of my study everytime I study.
