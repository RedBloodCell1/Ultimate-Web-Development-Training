Hello guys, It's me again. I have been gone for a while... Yeah, I have been sorting out my life. There is no deep reason for my disappearence. Its just I'm always getting lazy and lazy. Yeah you guys know how it goes. Its always been like this for the longest time now. Not something new. But I am back here, and will always be back no matter how long I stop for. Consider this my pledge.

So yeah, this lesson I am learning is a udemy lesson to be a fullstack dev. I always wanted to learn about everything inside out. I will take it slow and keep learning until I'm good enough. Well I will not talk to much, I will start. To see my progress. I will start to write the schedule of my study everytime I study.

Study Schedule:

- 02/11/2024 = 16:00 - 19.46 (1 hour)

- 17/12/2024 = 20:16 - 22:58 (31 minute 50 second)

YOOO THATS A LONG STOP. damn... welcome back me. Lets continue

- 19/12/2024 = 21:57 - 22:22 (5 minute)

- 26/12/2024 = 15:42 - 16:46 (20 minute 30 second)

I got no reason. Its really hard to keep up with things. Its always been like this. Stopping for a long time without coming back and it keeps repeating. How do i keep my discipline? I wanna be better. Its really harsh, the reality of life. Even tho I know that i need to study. My brain is so intoxicated in other things that studying become less of a priority.

Its 24/01/2025 today, its been quite a long time. Even if i spend an hour, i can only focus for an hour at best. This is just me trying to be fast at studying without taking my time slowly learning things. I feel really bad. But I know, there's no need to think so much. I just need to do what I need to do. Be more disciplined and keep going. I can't promise anything anymore because I dont wanna make a promise i can't keep. I know that I probably will stop again one day. But I promise that I will always come back. That is my promise. I don't know what kind of realization that I will get each time I come back. But I will be stronger.

- 24/01/2025 = 19:15 - 19:56 (27 Minute 16 Second)

And here i am 22/02/2025 Another 1 month of nothingness. I am going to study. Thats it

- 22/02/2025 (Failed to study cause of distraction)

- 05/03/2025 = Study

- 06/03/2025 = Study

- 13/03/2025 = Study

- 14/03/2025 = Study

- 15/03/2025 = Study

Lets take a moment to talk a little bit. I manage to be discipline for days now and I plan on continuing to do so. Like its really hard when i set up a time or like setting how long do i need to study. Now I just simply study when I want to and no matter how little or how long i study, i never feel bad about it.

I am proud of myself and I will keep this up so I will be able to study more and more. Because it really snowballs, the habit, the discipline, the mentality. Everything going forward will be even better. Don't need to dwell on how long I am gonna take to finish this all. But one thing I know is, I need to keep going forward and be the better version of myself everyday.

Everyday might look the same without any progress. Buy for someone who stumble upon this, I just wanna tell you guys that I have been in this journey for like 8 or 9 years trying to start something but never really stick with it until the end. Its hard because there is just so much thing that hinders us. But I promise you guys, You can do it too and probably with less time than I did.

I know this is just me blabbering. I have finished section 9 of this lesson. Lets see where I am at in a month now. See you guys later

You know, its kinda disheartening a little bit that I am late to publish new branch and got no contribution on 21/03/2025. But here I learn a new thing. Focus on whats matters. I really wanna make a green streak but because of today, I realize that, it doesn't even matter. What matters is I took my lesson seriously and get better. So from now on, focus on what matters. (the green streak thingies still looks cool tho)
