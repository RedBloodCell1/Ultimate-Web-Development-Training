# NOTES:

## Web Design Principles:

1. Colour Theory
2. Typography
3. User Interface Design
4. User Experience Design

### Colour Theory:

1. colorhunt.co website to look at color palate
2. Dont use opposite color for text and bg-color

### Typography:

1. 2 large families: Serif (tiny feet) and Sans Serif (No tiny feet)

### UI Design:

1. To draw attention, We can use color, size, layout, alignment, white space
2. **40-60 character** per line to be comfortable to read
3. **Bigger** size = more attention
4. **Less alignment** = better
5. **White space** (dont stick everything together) = better
6. **Audience** = Think about them, who you want to convey your design for

### User Experience:

1. User experience is something invisible not like UI design
2. 5 things to think of:
   - Simplicity
   - Consistency
   - Reading Pattern = F or Z pattern (Human eye when tracking website)
   - All platform design (PC and Mobile or others)
   - Dont use your powers for evil (Dark Pattern)?
