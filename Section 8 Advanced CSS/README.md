# NOTES:

## Display:

1. Inline = goes to same line
2. Block = Full width block
3. Inline-block = allow to set height and width
4. None = to hide things

## Float:

1. Float is to make text wrap around an image
2. clear is to clear things up so it doesnt interfere with the float image

## Way to make responsive website:

1. Media query = website width break point so that it changes css when reaching certain width
2. CSS Grid = Its a 2d grid which can have different size
3. CSS Flexbox = Its a 1d box which can have different size
4. Bootstrap Framework = OP things (automatic css)
