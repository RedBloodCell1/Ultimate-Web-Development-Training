# NOTES:

## Display:

1. Inline = goes to same line (So if i have 2 <h1> then i tell that the <h1> is inline then both the word or sentence will be in one line)
2. Block = Full width block (From left to right of the screen)
3. Inline-block = allow to set height and width (Its like a block but you can actually set the width and height)
4. None = to hide things

## Float:

1. **Float** is to make text wrap around an image
2. **Clear** is to clear things up so it doesnt interfere with the float image

## Way to make responsive website:

1. Media query = website width break point so that it changes css when reaching certain width
2. CSS Grid = Its a 2d grid which can have different size
3. CSS Flexbox = Its a 1d box which can have different size
4. Bootstrap Framework = OP things (automatic css)
