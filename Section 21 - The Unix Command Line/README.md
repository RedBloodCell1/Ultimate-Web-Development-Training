# Unix Command Line

## Notes:

1. GUI (Graphical User Interface) = Folder
2. CLI (Command Line Interface) = Command Prompt
3. **BASH (Bourne Again SHell)** -> CLI

## Command:

1. **ls** = LiSt files and directories
2. **cd** = Change Directory
3. **mkdir** = Make Directory
4. **touch** = Make file
5. **start** = To open file
6. **code** = To open the file in vscode
7. **rm** = Remove file (use -r to allow removing directory)
8. **clear** = to clear the terminal
9. **pwd** = Print Working Directory

## Neat Trick:

1. ctrl + a = Go to start
2. ctrl + e = Go to end
3. ctrl + u = Delete all without executing
4. `\* means everything
5.
