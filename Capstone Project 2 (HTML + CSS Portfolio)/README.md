# HTML + CSS Portfolio

This is where I try to make a website from scratch with HTML + CSS Completely on my own.

I never knew I would reach this point. Now, lets start making things step by step

## First Day:

1. First is the design. I want to make it so that people can see clearly what my skills are and also things about me. I dont want to make things to complicated and too cluttered. (I can just simply link my HTML portfolio so I don't need the same content on this portfolio).

2. I want The design to have 4 part:

   - Hero
   - My skill (In another part of the website):

     - Programming Language
     - Front end
     - Back end
     - Language
     - Miscallenous
     - Hobby

   - Contact me
   - Footer

3. I will design (Sketch) using paint

4. 2 Font I will choose = Nunito / Open Sans

5. For color, I will think about it tomorrow after the website is done (https://colorhunt.co/palette/1b262c0f4c753282b8bbe1fa)
