# NOTES:

## Display: Grid

1. Flex for 1d layout and Grid for 2d layout
2. grid-template-columns/rows: 1fr 2fr (So this means that the first column or row will be 1 fractional ratio and second one will be 2 fractional ratio). This means its simply 1:2 ratio

## Grid Sizing

1. When we use auto on a row = fit content
2. When we use auto on column = fit screen size
3. Using fr for fractional ratio
4. using minmax(400px,800px) = this is pretty self explanatory imo
5. grid-auto-rows = if we add 5 things inside our 2x2 grid, it will auto add rows with the px
