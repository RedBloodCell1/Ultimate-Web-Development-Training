# NOTES:

1. px = pixel 1/96 inch
2. pt = point 1/72 inch
3. em = 100% of parent (relative size to the parent)
4. rem = 100% of the root (relative size to the root)

Mostly we use rem because using em can be confusing from parent to parent. But rem will simply just use the root of everything which is usually the html tag
