# NOTES

## Bootstrap:

1. Bootstrap is CSS Framework. Simply this is premade css file which we can include to our project

## Bootstrap layout:

1. 12 Column system = We need **div container -> div row -> div col**
2. We can set **col-number** to set how many column we wanna take. (col-1 UNTIL col-12)
3. We can set something like col-sm-12 col-md-8 so we can have different sized for different viewport
4. For more info, just see the **layout documentation** on bootstrap
5. I have tried the exercise in *https://appbrewery.github.io/bootstrap-layout/* and its pretty simple after you get the hang of it. Just remember that the breakpoint is a min-width, and everything becomes simple

## Bootstrap Component:

1. **Buttons** = use **btn** class
2. **Cards** = use **card** class
3. **Navbar** = Man at this point, just go to the bootstrap documentation...
4. Go to icons to find free icons
5. Go to examples to see examples of things
